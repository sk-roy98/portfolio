                <h1>How useState made lazyness its feature?</h1>
                <small>May, 2021</small>
                <p>How good would it be to get appreciated and valued for being lazy!. We can just imagine but useState is proving it that being lazy can be good sometimes. let us know little about useState first. useState hook is a special function which takes one argument. The argument passed to useState is initial state value. It returns an array with two values. The first value is the initial value of the state variable and the second is a function (state dispatch function) which is used for updating state variable.</p>

                <h1>Promises and Async/Await in Javascript</h1>
                <small>May, 2021</small>
                <p>JavaScript is mainly single threaded that means only one line of code can be run in a given time. Which kind of spoils the user experience as the process becomes slow. For example: when we call function in sequence i.e., in a synchronous manner in that case until the previous function gets executed or returns something the next function wont get executed. But with the help of Promises and Async/Await JavaScript can perform long sequenced requests without any hurdles or waiting for any function in the sequence. which makes he process way more fast.</p>

                <h1>Is Node.js better than PHP</h1>
            <small>May, 2021</small>
            <p>The question is more like "Is a spoon better than fork ?". Well it depends on the food you are having, you can have noodles with spoon too, but not in a efficient way. Also you can have rice with fork but surely that will cause you enough trouble. Similarly, pretty much anything which you can do in PHP can be done in Node.js, you need to choose them depending on the task you want to do.</p>
